# Changelog

All notable changes to TokenParty are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- `tokenparty restart` command entered an infinite respawn loop because
  `daemonStart` filtered the literal `"start"` from child argv but not
  `"restart"`, so the spawned child re-entered the restart branch.
- `POST /api/restart` left the PID file stale (parent's old PID) so
  subsequent `tokenparty stop`/`status` targeted a dead process; the
  endpoint now refreshes the PID file with the new child's PID and
  detaches stdio so the parent's exit doesn't strand the child's
  output.
- Dashboard favicon (`/favicon.png`, `/favicon-64.png`) was served as
  `index.html` because only `/assets/*` had a static route and the
  catch-all swallowed every other path; added explicit serveStatic
  routes for the favicons ahead of the SPA catch-all.
